# D2R Lite

A mod pack for the original Diablo II game client that closely mimics the settings of Diablo II Resurrected.  This is designed to be paired with [D2R->D2LOD Save Converter](https://github.com/whipowill/node-d2s-converter) to make playing your characters seamless between clients.

## Mods

- 10x10 stash size.
- 3 pages of shared stash.
- Auto gold pickup.
- Ladder-only Runewords.
- Uber events, Diablo Clone.
- Loot filter (not in D2R).
- Map hack (not in D2R).

## Install

Paste in the files, run with ``-3dfx -direct -txt`` in the game shortcut.
