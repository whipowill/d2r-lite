# D2R Lite

A mod pack for the original Diablo II game client that closely mimics the settings of Diablo II Resurrected.  This is designed to be paired with [D2R->D2LOD Save Converter](https://github.com/whipowill/node-d2s-converter) to make playing your characters seamless between clients.

## Modifications

To match D2R:

- Widescreen resolutions
- 10x10 stash size
- 3 pages of shared stash
- Auto gold pickup
- Ladder-only Runewords
- Ebug doesn't work anymore
- Nilathek portal fixed
- Uber events w/ minions
- Diablo Clone

Extras not in D2R:

- Loot filter + map hack (optional)
- Relocate Cain in Act 5
